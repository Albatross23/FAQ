       <h3 class="faq-title">What is quantum computing?</h3>
       <p class="faq-text">
        Quantum computing is a field of computing that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform certain types of computations much more efficiently than classical computers. It uses quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling parallel processing and the potential to solve complex problems at a much faster rate.

        <h3 class="faq-title">How does quantum superposition work in quantum computing?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
            Quantum superposition allows qubits to exist in multiple states at the same time. Unlike classical bits, which can be either 0 or 1, qubits can be 0, 1, or any combination of both simultaneously. This property enables quantum computers to process a vast number of possibilities at once, potentially speeding up computations for certain algorithms.

        <h3 class="faq-title">What is quantum entanglement, and how is it used in quantum computing?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
            Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more qubits become correlated in such a way that the state of one qubit instantly influences the state of the other(s), regardless of the distance between them. In quantum computing, entanglement is used to link qubits, providing a means of sharing information and enhancing computational power.

        <h3 class="faq-title">Can quantum computers solve any problem faster than classical computers?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
            While quantum computers have the potential to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers, they are not universally faster for all types of computations. Quantum computers excel at tasks such as factoring large numbers, simulating quantum systems, and optimizing certain algorithms, but they may not be advantageous for every computational problem.

        <h3 class="faq-title"> What are some practical applications of quantum computing?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
            Quantum computing holds promise for various applications, including cryptography (breaking current encryption methods and creating quantum-safe encryption), optimization problems (supply chain optimization, financial modeling), drug discovery, and simulating quantum systems, such as understanding complex molecules.

        <h3 class="faq-title">Are quantum computers available for general use?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
            Currently, practical, general-purpose quantum computers are in the early stages of development. Some companies and research institutions offer cloud-based access to small-scale quantum processors for experimentation, but large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers are still a work in progress.
